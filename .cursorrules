# Bridgecore Flutter Package Rules

## Context7 Integration
- Always use Context7 MCP tools automatically when:
  - I need code generation or examples
  - I need library documentation
  - I need setup steps or API references
  - I ask about Flutter, Dart, or any third-party packages

## Flutter/Dart Specific
- Use Context7 to fetch latest Flutter and Dart documentation
- Check pub.dev packages documentation via Context7
- Verify API compatibility and best practices

## Language
- Prefer Arabic responses when user writes in Arabic
- Use English for code comments and documentation
